      <h1>St. Patrick&apos; Church Of Ireland Parish Church</h1>

      <p>The church was built in 1827 to a simple ‘hall and tower’ plan with harled walls in the Ulster-Scots manner and in an architectural style known as ‘First Fruits Gothic’. This design is typical of churches built across Ireland during the period 1808-1829, under the influence of an evangelical movement with the Church of Ireland, and with financial assistance from the government following the Act of Union. 
      </p>
      <p>John Henry Upton, 1st Viscount Templetown, donated the land for the church and graveyard, and paid for the residual construction costs.
      </p>
      <p>Initially the church was dedicated to St John the Evangelist, but in 1886 Bishop Reeves changed the dedication to St Patrick. Reeves was an authority on the history of the early Celtic church in Ireland and apparently considered the association with the Irish saint more appropriate for Templepatrick, literally the ‘church of Patrick’.
      </p>
      <p>Thanks to generous financial support from the Upton family, in 1889 a new chancel, organ recess and clergy vestry were added to the east end of the church, while the present porch, baptistery and small choir were constructed around the tower at the west end.  The brass font was donated by Susan Viscountess Templetown (having been brought by her brother from a church in the Crimea). The East Window [insert pic] in the chancel was a gift from her husband, George Frederick 3rd Viscount Templetown (1802-1890).
