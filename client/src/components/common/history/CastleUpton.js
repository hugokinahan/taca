        Amongst the original occupants of the site now known as Castle Upton
        were the Knights Templar, a military order given the land for services
        rendered to the Christian religion. The Knights established a priory
        within the grounds. After the demise of the Knights Templar, the
        property was given over to the Order of the Knights of St John who then
        occupied the priory (which is part of today’s main castle). Hugh de
        Lacey and his son confirmed the priorate in the 13th century. The
        Knights of St John retained possession of the site until 1568 when they
        were driven out at the time of the Protestant Reformation.

        The English started officially colonising Ireland in 1609. In 1611 (the
        date over the Castle’s impressive entrance) Arthur Chichester, Lord
        Deputy of Ireland during the reign of James 1, presented the land to one
        of his soldiers - Captain Humphrey Norton. Captain Norton built much of
        the present castle and renamed it ‘Castle Norton’. In 1625 the Castle
        was bought by Captain Henry Upton and became known as ‘Castle Upton’.
        Captain Upton second son of Arthur Upton Esquire of Lupton, Devon was a
        great nephew of Sir Nicholas Upton, one of the Knights of Malta.

        Captain Upton and his line fortified the original building with two
        flanking towers. For 300 years, the Castle protected its inhabitants
        from marauding armies sweeping through Ireland, especially during the
        1640s with the rebellions and royalist/Cromwellian civil wars. The
        five-foot thick walls, arrow slits and firing platforms in the basement,
        and the occasional discovery of a musket ball bear witness to this.

        The Castle was expanded in a Scottish baronial style as the Upton family
        flourished. Few family members throughout the generations seemed
        interested in the property until 1768 when Clotworthy Upton inherited
        the estate. In 1776 Clotworthy was elevated to the peerage and became
        Baron Templetown. His son, John, was later to become 1st Viscount
        Templeton.

        The family further improved the Castle by landscaping the park with the
        woods and gardens, and developing the river into a crayfish farm.
        Clotworthy invited his friend Robert Adam, the great Scottish architect,
        to modernise the interior and enhance the exterior. Adam was responsible
        for two phases of building work: • Phase 1 – extending the house by
        building the Great Dining Room and adding the West Tower, heightening
        the entrance hall by removing the floor of the bedroom above and putting
        in the woodwork and ceilings; • Phase 2 – building the Stable Yard (in
        1788) [insert pic ‘Entrance to the Adam Yard’] which is reputed to be an
        exact copy of the Old Fish Market in Edinburgh. The Yard is said to be
        one of the few examples of Adam deserting the Palladian style in favour
        of crenelated work. By the 1980s it had fallen into considerable
        disrepair and was gradually (over fifteen years or so) restored into 11
        private residences.

        In 1837, Edward Blore, an architect noted for completing Nash’s
        Buckingham Palace, was employed to carry out further renovation. He
        installed mullioned windows and internal panelling within the Castle.
        Blore also added a battlemented boundary wall within the distinctive
        Barbican gate lodge which was described as being of “punched granite
        with white porphyry quoins, mouldings and pinnacles” (OS Memoirs, 1838).

        The Viscounts Templeton remained major landowners in County Antrim up to
        the early years of the twentieth century. At this time there was a call
        for land reform. Under the Wyndham Act of 1903 Viscount Templeton sold
        his entire estate of 8000 acres. The Wyndham Act of took a long time to
        process and the onset of war in 1914 put a halt to the programme.

        During the First World War the estate was used for training by the
        Ulster Division with Nissan huts erected in the grounds, and - similarly
        - during the Second World War it was occupied by the American military,
        in preparation for D-day and their further involvement in Europe.

        The son of the 4th Earl was killed in the First World War. His brother,
        who succeeded as the 5th Viscount, left Castle Upton to marry an heiress
        who lived in Scotland. This led to a series of changes in occupancy and
        usage.

        Sir John Campbell, a surgeon, whose father was minister of Templepatrick
        Old Congregation, rented the house for a number of years and would have
        liked to have bought it. However, in 1923 it was sold to Mr Rea, a
        timber merchant who cut down 20,000 oak trees before selling it to
        Henderson Smith, an entrepreneur specialising in pigs. It is reputed
        that about this time the beautiful crenellation and ‘pepper pot’ turrets
        were removed and the south front taken down one storey.

        In 1963 Sir Robin and Lady Kinahan purchased the Castle (which at that
        time included gardens, land and a farm). They undertook to rebuild the
        ballroom, adding a fireplace from the Earl Bishop’s palace at Downhill.
        Over the next 50 years or so the Kinahan family added deer, horses,
        ponies, llamas and peacocks to the farm; and restored and re-roofed much
        of the Castle itself. Sir Robin and Lady Kinahan’s son, Danny, and his
        wife, Anna, also set up a wedding business and hosted many events at the
        Castle whilst living there. In the early 1990s a large amount of the
        surrounding land was leased and developed into a hotel and golf course,
        to ensure the upkeep of the property and its gardens.

        Castle Upton was sold in early 2019 and is now home to the Hughes
        family.
