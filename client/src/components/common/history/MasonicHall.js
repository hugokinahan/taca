      <p>Freemasonry in Templepatrick can be traced back to 1777 when warrant number 551 was issued to William Bradford, Archibald Agnew and James Boyd to hold a lodge in the village of Templepatrick. The brethren of this new lodge decided that they would stitch orange ribbon around their St Patrick’s blue aprons, to make their members easier to identify at the bi-annual St John’s day festivals held in June and December every year. The Lodge quickly became known as the ‘Orange and Blue Lodge No. 551 Templepatrick’. 
      </p>
      <p>The current warrant of St Paul’s No. 160 was taken out in 1826 in exchange for the Lodge’s previous warrant (No. 551). The reason for this exchange was that when lodges paraded on St John’s Day festivals the lower their lodge number the more prestigious their position in the parade.</p>
      <p>In the early 1800s the Lodge met in Craigarogan (a parish of Templepatrick) in Elisha Caruth’s, in the old club-house [insert pic of ‘The old club-house at the Roughfort, in the townland of Craigarogan’], and then in an inn “when the rule was adopted that half the fine should be spent in refreshment” (Bigger, 1897, p29). Between 1878 and 1885 the Lodge met in a room over the Roughfort school-house. It then moved to the courthouse in Templepatrick village where it met until 1897 when it moved to the present Masonic hall on the Antrim Road. </p>
      <p>Raising money in those days to pay for the building was a huge task but it was undertaken with determination and great zeal. A grand three-day bazaar was held in Templepatrick village schoolroom and grounds in June 1897. There were stalls for refreshments; flowers; sweets; tobacco; the post office; Punch and Judy; phrenology, palmistry and fortune telling. Other stalls were themed by ‘charity’, ‘friendship’, ‘truth’, and ‘justice’.  The bazaar also featured a bran tub; washing and hat trimming competitions; a shooting gallery; half-hour concerts and dances; gymnastic exhibitions; donkey rides; photography; an exhibition of motor cars; automatic machines; electric shocks; a home train for cyclists; and ballots. Special trains were organised and Masons, along with family and friends, came from all over Northern Ireland. Dukes, Lords and Ladies were patrons of the event. Brethren from all over the South Antrim area helped with the organisation of the event.</p>
      <p>Reflecting on names of Lodge members in the commemorative brochure for the bazaar, the following names stand out: William Birkmires, John Bill, H.R. Ashcroft and Alexander Bill; forefathers of some of the Lodge’s members in 2019. </p>
      <p>Shortly after the outbreak of World War 2 the Hall was commandeered by the War Officefor military purposes. The Lodge was granted the use of the village school (what is now theParish Hall) and met there until the Hall was de-requisitioned in 1944. </p>
      <p>The Masonic hall was home to other orders of Freemasonry such as Royal Arch Chapter 160,Templetown Preceptory and Westminster Masonic Lodge. For many years St Paul’s had over 100 members and Royal Arch Chapter had over 50 members. Sadly, due to population change, falling membership, and rising costs, the Hall is now closed. The warrants of the Lodge and Chapter were returned to Masonic Headquarters Dublin in 2019. </p>
