      <h4>The Parish Hall, The Early Years</h4>
      <p>The current Parish Hall was originally built in 1836 by Lord Templetown for the local Presbyterian congregation who had been worshipping in a barn at Kirkhill on the Kilmakee Road from 1831. Up until then, the Presbyterian congregation had worshipped in the Old Presbyterian Church on the main road through the village, but after a dispute over whether or not to subscribe to the Westminister Confession of Faith, a split occurred in the congregation. The majority, who believed in subscription left with the non-subscribers remaining in and retaining the Church building. </p>
      <p>Lord Templetown, noting the plight of the congregation and the unfavourable conditions under which they worshipped in the barn, kindly stepped in to provide the new Church building. The congregation spent eight happy years in their new Church until a dispute arose, the genesis of which is unclear, which resulted in Lord Templetown having the congregation evicted in September 1844. 
      </p>
      <h4>The School Years</h4>
      <p>Until 1970 the building which is now the Parish Hall (at the junction of Lylehill Road and Old Coach Road) was used as a school house for primary-school aged children.
      </p>
      <p>In the late 1960s the school consisted of three classes (one infant – for children aged 4 to 7, two junior – for children aged 8 to 11), two teachers (Mrs Nicholl and Mrs Foster), one headmaster (Mr Seymour) and about 18 children. 
      </p>
      <h4>One hall, three classes
      </h4>
      <p>The school’s three classes were taught in the main hall which was split into three sections. A folded wooden screen separated the infants from the rest of the school-children, and a curtain separated the two junior classes. Each child in the junior classes had their own desk with an individual ink-well. Discipline in class was strict – children did their work in silence.   
      </p>

      <p>The hall contained two big pot-bellied stoves which were needed to heat the whole building. One was located in the middle of the junior classes, thankfully it had a safety rail around it!
      </p>

      <p>The front door of the Hall led to a lobby which was windowless, dank and draughty, and included a row of cloakroom pegs for the children’s coats. Parents would gather in the lobby to collect their children at home time. The caretaker’s space near the lobby held brooms, buckets and a large Belfast sink. The sink was at ground level which meant the children could easily use it, for example, to wash their paint pots. 
      </p>
      <h4>Storage
      </h4>
      <p>The Hall did not offer much storage space so teachers tended to stack books and papers on the window sills, and children kept their books in their desks. A large cupboard in the infants section contained slates, paints, and cooking utensils. A free-standing blackboard and pointer were kept in the main hall. 
      </p>
      <h4>The headmaster’s desk</h4>
      <p>The headmaster had a high-standing lectern-type desk, in which he kept a cane and some sweets. The cane was very rarely used but the sweets were given out regularly. The school-bell sat on the headmaster’s desk. It was used at morning, break and lunch. The children were allowed to ring the bell as a special treat. 
      </p>
      <h4>Break time</h4>
      <p>When the bell rang to signal a break the centre curtain was drawn back and children piled out of the school via the back door. Unsupervised, but within view of the headmaster’s office, the children played outside (often in the field which is now Temple Court) and visited the outside toilets. As there was no outdoor plumbing these toilets were basically buckets!
      </p>
      <p>Teachers would gather round the stoves for their cups of tea and to keep warm. Mrs Nicholl (the infant teacher) would heat small bottles of milk on the stove for the children.
      </p>
      <p>The school-house closed around 1970 when a new school primary school was built on the Lylehill Road. The new school amalgamated the two Templepatrick national schools and the Lylehill school.
