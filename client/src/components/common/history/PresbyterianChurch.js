      <p>   In 1607, Arthur Chichester (Lord Deputy of Ireland during the reign of James 1), presented land which included what we now know as ‘Castle Upton’ to one of his soldiers - Captain Humphrey Norton. Captain Norton arranged for the Episcopal Church of St John to be built on the site now occupied by the Mausoleum. Captain Norton soon found himself at odds with, and displeased by, the ministry of the curate Mr Tracey. Having heard favourable reports about a young Scottish Presbyterian preacher called Josias Welch (grandson of John Knox the Scottish reformer), Captain Norton removed Mr Tracey from the pulpit and installed Josias Welch as the first minister of Templepatrick Presbyterian Church in 1625.
      </p>
      <p>After Josias Welch’s ministry a further five Presbyterian ministers served the congregation until the early 1800s. Around this time a schism developed within the congregation over whether the minister and his followers should subscribe to the Westminster Confession of Faith (which had been accepted as the standard doctrine of theology by the Presbyterian Church in Ireland). The minister at the time, Reverend Robert Campbell (1796-1831), would not adhere to this doctrine and so the Church became known as the ‘Non-subscribing Church of Templepatrick’. The majority of the congregation left and began to worship in a barn at Kirkhill on the Kilmakee Road.</p>

      <p>The present church was built in 1784 before the congregational split. In 1881 major renovations were carried out at a cost of £620 with the windows, pulpit and pews being renewed. The pulpit was re-sited on the north wall and the entrance door relocated to the south wall. In 1902 it was found necessary to renew the roof at a cost of £420.</p>
