      <h1>Templepatrick Mills</h1>
      <hr></hr>
      <p>Templepatrick’s mills (situated in the townland of Cloughanduff) were established in the eighteenth century. The mills, a corn mill and a flax mill, were about half a mile from the village, on what is now the Old Ballyclare Road. The mill house was opposite the mills. 
      </p>
      <p>The location of the mills was dictated by the requirement for a water supply to power the two water wheels. A weir across the Ballymartin River (some half-a-mile away in the townland of Ballymartin) enabled the flow of the river to be diverted through a control sluice gate, along the mill race, and into a two-acre dam adjacent to the mills. Separate sluice gates controlled the flow to the two breast wheels which sat in tandem between the mills. The corn-mill wheel had a diameter of 14’6” and was 5’ wide. The flax-mill wheel had a diameter of 12’ and was 4’6” wide. Both wheels had an 8’ fall.

      <p>In 1850 the mills and mill house were in the ownership of the 2nd Viscount Templetown and the miller was a D. Bill. From this time the Bill family were the millers. Around 1890 the mills and the mill house were bought from the 4th Viscount Templetown by J. Bill; they have remained in Bill family ownership since that time.

      <p>The flax mill had six scutching stocks which accommodated six scutchers. They were serviced by strickers, usually four, who put the flax through a set of five rollers or crimpers. The flax was put through in stricks to break the woody inner core before it was passed to the scutchers. The scutchers removed the woody core from the fibre leaving it hair-like and ready to be sold on to be woven into linen. 
      </p>

      <p>Until around the mid-1940s many of the young village men, after leaving school, would start off working in the flax mill. However, as stricking was seasonal work, most would go on to seek permanent employment elsewhere. 
      </p>
      <p>The corn mill had two sets of grinding stones and one set of rollers. In the earlier times, when the farmers brought grain, the miller could take a legal portion of the flour in lieu of payment. This was then sold to the village residents and so the miller was recompensed for his work.
      </p>

      <p>During the Second World War the mills were extremely busy - the linen was in great demand for war use and the corn mill provided meal for animals. After the war use of the mills decreased. The flax mill ceased working in 1954 and the corn mill in 1961. The corn mill has since been converted into a comfortable home [insert pic] and the flax mill into an attractive garage and store. The mill house unfortunately no longer exists.
