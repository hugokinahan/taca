      <h1>Orange Hall</h1>
      <hr></hr>
      <p>Templepatrick Orange Hall was officially opened on Easter Monday 1924. It was built by members of Templepatrick Orange Lodge “as a thanks offering for the end of the Great War, a memorial to those who have fallen, and in recognition of their brethren who served in the war” (as inscribed on the memorial stone on the front wall). Twenty-seven members of the Lodge served in the First World War (1914-1918) [insert Roll of Honour pic]; six did not return home.</p>

      <p>The 4 ft2 white marble memorial stone is inscribed with the following words: “Templepatrick War Memorial Orange Hall | Erected 1923 | In memory of our gallant dead | 1914 – 1918 | These do not mind our praise or tears | We need their courage through the coming years”. [insert memorial stone pic].</p>

      <p>The Hall cost approximately £2000 to build; a huge amount of money in those days. The population of Templepatrick was just 160 so fundraising this amount of money was an enormous task. A three-day grand bazaar was organised in June 1920. It was a huge success and over £1600 was raised. The remainder of the funds needed were acquired through donations and smaller fundraising events.</p>

      <p>The Hall’s foundation stone was laid on 8 September 1923 [insert Foundation stone pic]. The Worshipful Master of the Lodge, David Bill, placed the following under the foundation stone: a sealed jar containing several coins, a roll of the members, and the names of the architect and chairman.</p>

      <p>The Hall has been used by a wide range of groups, and for variety of purposes, over the years. For example: flower shows, ‘old tyme’ dances, Sunday school classes, church meetings, bird shows, wedding parties, badminton clubs, charity groups, and nursery school groups. It was used as a military base for British and American troops during the Second World War and even served as the local Magistrates Court during the 1940s/50s. [insert pic of lion and unicorn]</p>

      <p>The Hall is regularly maintained by Lodge members. In 2009 a major refurbishment took place to restore and renovate the interior and exterior.</p>

      <p>It is hoped that for generations to come the Hall remains as a memorial to those who were affected by the Great War.</p>
