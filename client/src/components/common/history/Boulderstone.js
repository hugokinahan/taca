      <h1>Boulderstone House</h1>
      <hr></hr>
      <p>This handsome two-storey house was built in 1832 on land donated by Viscount Templetown. Sited immediately behind the rear wall of St Patrick’s churchyard, it was intended to serve as a glebe house or vicarage for the officiating Church of Ireland clergyman at the recently built church. 
      </p>
      <p>Boulderstone’s first occupant was Reverend Hammond Dawson, the curate of the church until he left Templepatrick in 1841. It is not known if his successor, Reverend Kerr, or the next vicar, Dr Miller, ever lived at Boulderstone, but we do know that when Reverend T.B. Adair became vicar of Templepatrick in 1848, he chose to reside at his family home (Loughanmore House, Dunadry). Reverend Deacon, curate of St Patrick’s during the late 1860s, was the last clerical resident of Boulderstone; after his tenure the House ceased to function as a vicarage.
      </p>

      <p>In 1872, a new parish vicarage (Kingscourt), was built on a site on the Antrim Road. Kingscourt served as the vicarage until the 1980s when it became a nursing home. 
      </p>

      <p>No longer a glebe house, Boulderstone was let to Captain G.T. Brooke, a retired army officer. Captain Brooke was also a magistrate for County Antrim; this may account for the use at that time of one of the outbuildings as a courthouse.
      </p>

      <p>After Brooke died in 1879 Boulderstone was rented out to a succession of tenants by the Templetown estate. It went through a number of changes including use as a school for girls in the early 20th century.
      </p>

      <p>The house is now in private ownership.
