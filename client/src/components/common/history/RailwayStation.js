      <hr></hr>
      <p>Templepatrick Railway station was opened on 11th April 1848 as part of the Belfast and Ballymena Railway which was later integrated into the Northern Counties Committee group of lines owned by LMS. At the stage it was titled ‘a flag halt’.

      </p>
      <p>The station closed in September 1961 and reopened for a short time between June 1980 and February 1981.
      </p>

      <p>The station is built on an embankment on top of a basalt structure. The building was finished in red brick with black and yellow decorative elements.   This height made loading goods difficult so a hook and line was used to raise heavy items to the platform.

      </p>

      <p>The main goods area of the line was on the Belfast end on the Up side with a signal box opposite.

      </p>

      <p>During the war, a siding was in use to transport the bauxite ore from the Lylehill mines.
