      <h1>Templetown Mausoleum</h1>
      <hr></hr>
      <p>Templetown Mausoleum is a National Trust property and is situated in the grounds of Castle Upton. It is signposted from the A6 Antrim Road where it runs through Templepatrick. By following the sign down to the bottom of the lane and then entering through the gates into the graveyard you will find the mausoleum.</p>
      <p>It is one of the few works in Ireland by the renowned Scottish architect Robert Adam (1728-1792). Adam, a friend of Clotworthy Upton, 1st Baron Templetown (1721-1785), visited Castle Upton in 1770 to advise on improvements to the Castle.</p>
      <p>Brett (1996, p.287) commented that the building is the finest example in Ireland of Adam&apos;s neoclassical architecture and noted that it is “...at once, severe and richly detailed.”  The front elevation is ornate whilst the other elevations and the interior are plain. According to Brett the north wall on the original plan was also to be decorated. Externally, the inscription over the entrance arch reads, “Sacred to the memory of the Right Honourable Arthur Upton.” Internally, an inscription in the tympanum of the recessed arch at the rear states, “This building is erected by Sarah Upton to perpetuate the memory of an husband she loved and esteemed...”

      <p>Sarah Upton was the second wife of Arthur Upton who died in 1768. In 1771 she married the Earl of Farnham who died eight years later. The mausoleum was built in1789 twenty-one years after the death of Rt. Hon. Arthur Upton whom it commemorates.</p>
      <p>Inside the building are five memorial plaques. Arthur Upton died childless and his title and estate passed to his youngest brother Clotworthy (as the middle child Francis had predeceased his brothers). Chronologically, the first person commemorated on a plaque was John Henry Upton (one of the four children of Clotworthy Upton and his wife Mary Montagu). The other four plaques are in memory of the five children of John Henry Upton and his wife Elizabeth Boughton, namely Henry Montagu, George Frederick, Arthur, Edward John, and Mary Wilhemina. Arthur and Wilhemina share one plaque. The last plaque was erected in 1890.</p>
